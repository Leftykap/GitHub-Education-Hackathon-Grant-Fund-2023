## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the Github Grant funding to make sure we had enough money to run the event. We were able to have enough money to run the midnight Bubble Tea event just like last year, which was a huge success once again. Just like last year, we don't earmark funds for specific things, and so these funds also helped with things like food, stickers, shirts, and more.

## Top Projects

- Our first place project was [DAVE](https://devpost.com/software/dasz), using artificial intelligence to help those with visual imparements better navigate the world
- [Another](https://devpost.com/software/decolawnize) created a resource to find easy, native lawn plant replacements
- One [especially creative](https://devpost.com/software/github-ide) use of github (which won that award), used the GitHub API to automatically update the README of their repo using the output of the program.
